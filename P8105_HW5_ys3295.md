## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Let’s look at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate ……..

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

``` r
city_prop_test = function(df) {
  
  n_unsovled 
  n_total 
  
  prop.test(.....)
  
}



homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL") %>% 
  nest(data = resolved)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

# Problem 2

Start with a datafram containing all file names.

``` r
names_df = list.files('lda_data')
file_names_df = str_c("lda_data/",names_df)
```

Iterate over file names and read in data.\`

Building up the dataset for the further analyses.

``` r
 tidy_long_data = 
  long_data %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("group","id","csv")) %>% 
  select(-csv) %>% 
  select(id,group,everything()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "observational_value"
  ) 
```

Making the spaghetti plot.

``` r
tidy_long_data %>% 
  group_by(id,group) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observational_value, group = id,color = id)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    x = "weeks",
    y = "observations",
    caption = "Longitudinal Study for Control and Experimental Arm through Time") + 
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0))+
  facet_grid(. ~ group)
```

<img src="P8105_HW5_ys3295_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="90%" />

Several similarity and differences between control and experimental
group are shown in the plots. The observation values is fluctuating
during the 8 weeks. The figures indicates that the trend for control
group tends to keep constant through 8 weeks while the experimental
group showed an increasing trend during this period.

# Problem 3

Setting up the function

``` r
sim_mean = function(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
   sim_data %>% 
      t.test() %>% 
      broom::tidy() 
}
```

Testing the function

``` r
sim_results = rerun(5000, sim_mean(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

Simulating across multiple means

``` r
mu_list = 
  list(
    "mu_1" = 0,
    "mu_2" = 1, 
    "mu_3" = 2, 
    "mu_4" = 3, 
    "mu_5" = 4,
    "mu_6" = 5,
    "mu_7" = 6
    )
output = vector("list", length = 7)

for (i in 1:7) {
  output[[i]] = rerun(5000, sim_mean(mu = mu_list[[i]])) %>% 
    bind_rows
}
```

``` r
sim_results =
  tibble(
  mu = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~ rerun(5000, sim_mean(mu = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)
  ) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs) %>% 
  select(mu,estimate, p.value)
```

``` r
test_df = 
  sim_results %>% 
  mutate(
    test_results = case_when(p.value < 0.05 ~ "rejected",
                            p.value >= 0.05 ~ "failed to reject")
  ) %>% 
  select(mu, test_results) %>% 
  group_by(mu) %>%
  summarize(
    reject_num = sum(test_results == "rejected")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(power = reject_num / 5000)
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
test_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mu, y = power)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    title = "The proportion of times the null was rejected")
```

<img src="P8105_HW5_ys3295_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="90%" />

  - The figure showed that as the effect size increase, the power will
    increase.
